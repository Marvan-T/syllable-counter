Uses a fallback methodâ€”based on the [NLTK readability plugin][nltk] by Thomas Jakobsen <thomj05@student.uia.no> and Thomas Skardal <thomas04@student.uia.no>. This NLTK plugin is itself based on the algorithm implemented in the [Lingua::EN::Syllable perl module][perl] by Greg Fast <gdf@imsa.edu>.

Thanks to them for making their work available.

## Requirements

To use this Java library, you need Java 8 and Maven 3.

## Installation

Refer to the [Maven Central page](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:eu.crydee%20a:syllable-counter) to find the installation instructions for your build tool or to download the jar directly.

## Usage

The usage is trivial. To retrieve the number of syllables of a word, use the `count` method:

```java
import eu.crydee.syllablecounter.SyllableCounter;

...

SyllableCounter sc = new SyllableCounter();
int myCount = sc.count("facility");
// myCount holds 4
```
